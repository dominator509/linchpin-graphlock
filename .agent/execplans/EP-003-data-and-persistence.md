# EP-003 - Data and Evidence

Requirements: REQ-DATA-001, REQ-RES-001. Dependencies: EP-002.

## Scope
This node owns only the paths/components necessary for data and evidence. It may not weaken prior specs/tests or introduce unapproved external services. All external names/versions are re-verified from repo/first-party evidence before transcription.

## Milestones

### M1 - SQLCipher schema + migrations + repository ports
Acceptance oracle: a requirement-scoped test/evidence target proves the real behavior and fails when the behavior is removed or policy is violated.
Order: add/confirm stable test ID -> demonstrate red when feasible -> implement/transcribe production change -> run narrow green -> run negative/mutation -> run milestone verification -> write evidence -> commit.
Evidence: `.agent/evidence/EP-003/M1/`. Do not use mocks as the final dependency proof.

### M2 - Encrypted content-addressed Evidence Vault
Acceptance oracle: a requirement-scoped test/evidence target proves the real behavior and fails when the behavior is removed or policy is violated.
Order: add/confirm stable test ID -> demonstrate red when feasible -> implement/transcribe production change -> run narrow green -> run negative/mutation -> run milestone verification -> write evidence -> commit.
Evidence: `.agent/evidence/EP-003/M2/`. Do not use mocks as the final dependency proof.

### M3 - DuckDB/Parquet/Tantivy derived-index pipeline
Acceptance oracle: a requirement-scoped test/evidence target proves the real behavior and fails when the behavior is removed or policy is violated.
Order: add/confirm stable test ID -> demonstrate red when feasible -> implement/transcribe production change -> run narrow green -> run negative/mutation -> run milestone verification -> write evidence -> commit.
Evidence: `.agent/evidence/EP-003/M3/`. Do not use mocks as the final dependency proof.

### M4 - USPTO/EPO/science source adapter contracts and at least one live official data readback
Acceptance oracle: a requirement-scoped test/evidence target proves the real behavior and fails when the behavior is removed or policy is violated.
Order: add/confirm stable test ID -> demonstrate red when feasible -> implement/transcribe production change -> run narrow green -> run negative/mutation -> run milestone verification -> write evidence -> commit.
Evidence: `.agent/evidence/EP-003/M4/`. Do not use mocks as the final dependency proof.

### M5 - Backup/restore/rebuild/restart/concurrency proof
Acceptance oracle: a requirement-scoped test/evidence target proves the real behavior and fails when the behavior is removed or policy is violated.
Order: add/confirm stable test ID -> demonstrate red when feasible -> implement/transcribe production change -> run narrow green -> run negative/mutation -> run milestone verification -> write evidence -> commit.
Evidence: `.agent/evidence/EP-003/M5/`. Do not use mocks as the final dependency proof.

## Closure
Run owned tests plus affected regressions; update traceability and dependency proofs; run anti-gaming scan/review; run architecture drift gate; account applicable DoD clauses; append hash-ledger event. DONE_VERIFIED is forbidden while evidence is missing or a core dependency remains blocked.
