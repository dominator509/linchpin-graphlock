# EP-002 - Core Domain

Requirements: REQ-DOM-001, REQ-DOM-010. Dependencies: EP-001.

## Scope
This node owns only the paths/components necessary for core domain. It may not weaken prior specs/tests or introduce unapproved external services. All external names/versions are re-verified from repo/first-party evidence before transcription.

## Milestones

### M1 - Implement domain IDs/entities/state machines
Acceptance oracle: a requirement-scoped test/evidence target proves the real behavior and fails when the behavior is removed or policy is violated.
Order: add/confirm stable test ID -> demonstrate red when feasible -> implement/transcribe production change -> run narrow green -> run negative/mutation -> run milestone verification -> write evidence -> commit.
Evidence: `.agent/evidence/EP-002/M1/`. Do not use mocks as the final dependency proof.

### M2 - Human Conception vs AI Suggestion invariants
Acceptance oracle: a requirement-scoped test/evidence target proves the real behavior and fails when the behavior is removed or policy is violated.
Order: add/confirm stable test ID -> demonstrate red when feasible -> implement/transcribe production change -> run narrow green -> run negative/mutation -> run milestone verification -> write evidence -> commit.
Evidence: `.agent/evidence/EP-002/M2/`. Do not use mocks as the final dependency proof.

### M3 - Opportunity vector and evidence/uncertainty types
Acceptance oracle: a requirement-scoped test/evidence target proves the real behavior and fails when the behavior is removed or policy is violated.
Order: add/confirm stable test ID -> demonstrate red when feasible -> implement/transcribe production change -> run narrow green -> run negative/mutation -> run milestone verification -> write evidence -> commit.
Evidence: `.agent/evidence/EP-002/M3/`. Do not use mocks as the final dependency proof.

### M4 - Claim limitation/support graph + design-around records
Acceptance oracle: a requirement-scoped test/evidence target proves the real behavior and fails when the behavior is removed or policy is violated.
Order: add/confirm stable test ID -> demonstrate red when feasible -> implement/transcribe production change -> run narrow green -> run negative/mutation -> run milestone verification -> write evidence -> commit.
Evidence: `.agent/evidence/EP-002/M4/`. Do not use mocks as the final dependency proof.

### M5 - Filing/disclosure/docket/commercialization state rules
Acceptance oracle: a requirement-scoped test/evidence target proves the real behavior and fails when the behavior is removed or policy is violated.
Order: add/confirm stable test ID -> demonstrate red when feasible -> implement/transcribe production change -> run narrow green -> run negative/mutation -> run milestone verification -> write evidence -> commit.
Evidence: `.agent/evidence/EP-002/M5/`. Do not use mocks as the final dependency proof.

## Closure
Run owned tests plus affected regressions; update traceability and dependency proofs; run anti-gaming scan/review; run architecture drift gate; account applicable DoD clauses; append hash-ledger event. DONE_VERIFIED is forbidden while evidence is missing or a core dependency remains blocked.
